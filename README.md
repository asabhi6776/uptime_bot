## Prerequisites

- Python 3.5 or newer
- The `discord.py` library: `pip install discord.py`
- A Discord bot. You can create one by going to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and creating a new application. Click on the "Create a Bot" button to create a bot user. Take note of the bot's token, as you will need it later.

## Usage

1. Set the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable to your bot's token.
2. Run the code using `python your_file_name.py`.
3. Use the `!uptime` command in a Discord channel to check the uptime of a URL. For example, if you wanted to check the uptime of `https://www.example.com`, you would type `!uptime https://www.example.com` in the Discord channel.
